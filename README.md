# Blinkit_dataset_analysis

Project overview
The Blinkit Dataset here shows delivery performance across orders, highlighting on-time rate, delay distribution, delivery time versus distance patterns, and top delay reasons. It tracks trends by date and identifies outliers and partners driving delays to guide operational improvements. It also has insights about the stock that is recieved in the warehouses and whether it is damaged or correct along with the quantity and price of the items.
